         <p className='introaboutme'>Hello I am Kimberley. I started this as a hobby and then realized
         how the statistics of preemie babies have risen in the past few years due to many people having babies later
         on in their lives.</p>
         
         <p className='introaboutme'>I also realized while looking for baby clothes from shops that there is not really any preemie clothes that don't
         cost a fortune or are in limited stock! So I decided to take my hobby and help those with tiny tots and full term
         tots at getting some items of clothing and accessories that are made in a loving, caring, covid-19 free and safe home!</p>
         
         <p className='introaboutme'>Freyjaheim is located in Sweden. I opened up Freyjaheim from my house which is free from covid-19 and a safe enviorment!</p>
         
         <p className='introaboutme'>All products are made with 100% acrylic and bamboo or a mix of the both wool no animals were harmed in making the wool/yarn.</p>
